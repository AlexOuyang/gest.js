#PRESENTATION AT MELBJS

This is a short presentation I gave that summarises gest.js: [http://hadimichael.github.io/gestjs-presentation/](http://hadimichael.github.io/gestjs-presentation/)

#gest.js IN THE WILD

The University of Connecticut are using gest.js on a large-screen lobby display [http://grad.uconn.edu/lobbydisplay/winter/](http://grad.uconn.edu/lobbydisplay/winter/) - thanks to [@joelsalisbury](http://twitter.com/joelsalisbury)

Gesture game [http://thirst-staging.com/experiments/gest/](http://thirst-staging.com/experiments/gest/) - thanks to [@LochieAxo](http://twitter.com/LochieAxo)

I'd love to know how you will use gest.js! Please get in touch - [@hadi_michael](http://twitter.com/hadi_michael)

#EXAMPLES

A simple gest.js demo that displays the gesture direction on screen: [http://hadimichael.github.io/gest.js/demos/simple/index.html](http://hadimichael.github.io/gest.js/demos/simple/index.html)

#USAGE

##Include the library (gest.js)
You will need to include the 'gest.js' library using something like:

<code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="gest.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>

##Start gesture detection
You can start gest.js by calling:
<code>gest.start();</code>

##Listening for recognised gestures
You will need to register an event listener on the <code>document</code> for <code>gest</code> using:
<pre><code>document.addEventListener('gest', function(gesture) {
	//handle gesture .direction .up .down .left .right .error
}, false);
</code></pre>

##How to handle recognised gestures
On every event, you will be passed a <code>gesture</code> object that contains:

- <code>.direction</code> the recognised gesture in words as a string
- <code>.up</code> boolean, true if the recognised gesture is up
- <code>.down</code> boolean, true if the recognised gesture is down
- <code>.left</code> boolean, true if the recognised gesture is left
- <code>.right</code> boolean, true if the recognised gesture is right
- <code>.error</code> an error object with...
	- <code>.code</code> a code as an int
	- <code>.message</code> and a message as a string

##Stop gesture detection
You can stop gest.js at any time by calling:
<code>gest.stop();</code>

##Using Options

###Skin Filtering (off by default)
To improve recognition, you may choose to enable HSV skin filtering. You can do so by using:
<code>gest.options.skinFilter = true;</code>

###Messages (on by default)
gest.js shows on screen messages as user feedback, you can control these using:
<code>gest.options.messages = false;</code>

###Locking (0 by default)
Sometimes gest.js may rapidly pick up two consecutive gestures, often the second of these gestures is in error. To help mitigate this, you can set a <code>locking</code> option in milliseconds. This will lock gest.js and stop it from dispatching gest events. On screen messages however, will continue to be displayed. To set a locking timeout, use:
<code>gest.options.locking = 500;</code>

###Debugging (off by default)
In order to view the video stream and enable <code>console.log(â€¦)</code> messages, you will need to toggle debugging using:
<code>gest.options.debug(true);</code>

#TODO

- Code cleanup (particularly around visuals)
- Better Firefox support...
- bespoke.js plugin
